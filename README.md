# Weatherlove
A minimal but functional weather app. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API.

A project for the [Midnight](https://midnight.hackclub.com) hackathon, by [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)

## Getting Started
Make a .env file and paste your OpenWeatherMap API key into a variable called "OWM_API_KEY".

The rest was just from the Next.js template, but these instructions should still work.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
